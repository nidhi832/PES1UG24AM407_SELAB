## Overview

This project is an enhanced real-time 2D platformer developed in Python with **Pygame**. The lab assignment focused on **VibeCoding** — collaborative, iterative pair programming with an advanced AI coding assistant to diagnose, debug, refactor, and expand a game codebase.

Through prompt engineering and iterative testing, critical game-feel bugs (such as collision tunneling) were eliminated, and key gameplay features (dynamic difficulty selection, sound synthesis, game-over state handling, and hazard balancing) were implemented.

## Tasks & Implementations

### Task 1: Refined Platform Collision Detection
* **Issue:** At high falling speeds or after falling from high platforms, the player character suffered from "tunneling" (phasing straight through solid platform floors).
* **Fix:** 
  - Implemented **continuous swept collision detection** along the vertical axis (`prev_bottom <= platform.y + 4 and new_bottom >= platform.y`), checking if the player's downward trajectory intersected the platform's top boundary during the frame step.
  - Added a **terminal velocity cap** (`16.0`) to avoid oversized displacement steps per frame.
  - Properly snaps the player to the platform surface (`y = platform.y - height`) and resets vertical velocity (`vy = 0`).

### Task 2: Game Over Screen & State Machine
* **Issue:** Dying (falling into gaps or colliding with hazards) previously printed to stdout or abruptly exited.
* **Fix:**
  - Introduced explicit `game_over` state tracking within `GameEngine`.
  - Added a semi-transparent darkened overlay (`pygame.SRCALPHA`) with a clear **GAME OVER** banner.
  - Displays the player's **Final Score** and interactive prompt options.
  - Suspends gameplay movement physics while gracefully capturing player inputs.

### Task 3: Replay Menu & Dynamic Difficulty Tuning
* **Issue:** Players had to relaunch the entire game upon dying.
* **Fix:**
  - Added full replay functionality directly from the Game Over screen without restarting the Python process.
  - Implemented 3 selectable difficulty levels with custom-tuned gravity and jump impulse parameters:
    - **Easy (`1` / `E`):** `gravity = 0.45`, `jump_strength = -13.0` (Floaty, forgiving jumps)
    - **Medium (`2` / `M` / `Space` / `Enter`):** `gravity = 0.60`, `jump_strength = -12.0` (Standard balanced platformer physics)
    - **Hard (`3` / `H`):** `gravity = 0.78`, `jump_strength = -11.0` (Fast falls, tight jump timing)
  - Exit shortcut (`Q` / `Escape`) to cleanly quit the application.

### Task 4: Sound Effects & Audio Integration
* **Issue:** The original starter game had zero audio feedback.
* **Fix:**
  - Developed a standalone `SoundManager` class (`game/sound.py`) interfacing with `pygame.mixer`.
  - Synthesized clean 16-bit 44.1 kHz PCM audio assets in `assets/sounds/`:
    - `jump.wav`: Upward frequency sweep triggered when jumping.
    - `goal.wav`: Multi-tone arpeggio fanfare played when touching the green goal pole.
    - `death.wav`: Low-frequency rumble/noise burst played on hazard collision or fall deaths.
  - Built with graceful fallback handling if audio drivers or hardware are unavailable.

### Bonus Balancing: Hazard Geometry Optimization
* **Issue:** The default hazard was positioned awkwardly, rendering the jump nearly impossible on higher difficulties.
* **Fix:** Resized the hazard hitbox to 40px width and centered it cleanly on the platform (`Platform(220, ...)`), making the obstacle fair, readable, and rewarding to leap over.
